    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>At WordFusion, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our extension or website.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information that is necessary to provide our service, which includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Text Input:</strong> We collect text that you select on a webpage and send it to our server for translation.</li>
      <li><strong>Language Preference:</strong> We store your preferred language (selected via the extension) to enhance your experience.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect any personal information or data unrelated to the text you actively choose to translate or your language settings.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely for the purpose of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing text translation services based on your selection.</li>
      <li>Enhancing your experience by storing your language preference locally in your browser for future use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Your language preferences (langCode, langName) are stored locally on your device using <strong>localStorage</strong> in your browser. This data is not transmitted to any external server except for the translation service, which processes the selected text.</p>

    <h2>4. No Personal Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or distribute any personal data. The only data sent to our server is the text you select for translation, which is processed and returned in the form of translated text. We do not store your browsing history or any personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>5. External Servers</h2>
    <p>Our extension communicates with an external server for translation purposes. The server only processes the selected text and returns the translation. No other data is collected or stored by the server.</p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable precautions to ensure that the data we handle is secure. However, as with any digital service, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data transmitted over the internet.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:imrujnila+1@example.com">imrujnila+1@gmail.com</a>.</p>
